# Privacy Policy — Agentic

**Last updated:** February 2025

## Overview
Agentic is an AI chat client developed by Gauss (Giulio Leone). This app connects to third-party AI providers using API keys that you provide.

## Data Collection
Agentic does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data to our servers. We have no servers.

### What stays on your device:
- Chat conversations
- API keys (stored in hardware-backed secure storage)
- Server configurations
- App preferences

### What is sent to third-party AI providers:
- Your chat messages (sent to the AI provider you configure)
- Attached images (if using vision-capable models)

This data is transmitted directly from your device to the AI provider's API endpoint. Agentic does not intercept, log, or store this data outside your device.

## Third-Party Services
When you configure an AI provider (e.g., OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic), your messages are subject to that provider's privacy policy:
- [OpenRouter Privacy Policy](https://openrouter.ai/privacy)
- [OpenAI Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy/)
- [Anthropic Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)

## Permissions
- **Camera:** Used for taking photos to share with AI (optional)
- **Microphone:** Used for voice input (optional)
- **Internet:** Required to communicate with AI providers

## Data Deletion
All data is stored locally on your device. Uninstalling the app removes all data completely.
